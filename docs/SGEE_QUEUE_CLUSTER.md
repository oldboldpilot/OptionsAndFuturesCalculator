# SGEE queue cluster — topology, and what the durability audit actually found

@author Olumuyiwa Oluwasanmi

Status as of 2026-08-11: **deployed as a non-authoritative mirror. Postgres
remains the system of record.** The evidence for that decision is below, and it
is not "we have not got round to it" — it is a measured, reproducible defect in
the read path.

## Topology

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Services | `sgee-queue-1`, `sgee-queue-2`, `sgee-queue-3` (project `fearless-amazement`, environment `production`) |
| Replicas per service | **1**, and this is not adjustable |
| Volume | one per service, mounted at `/data` |
| Image | `backend/Dockerfile.queue-node` |
| Consensus port | 50052 (Raft + SWIM, `[::]`) |
| Client queue port | 50053 (TaskQueue gRPC, `[::]`) |
| Health/status port | 8080 — `/healthz`, `/statusz` |

Three services rather than one service with three replicas, for three
independent reasons, any one of which is sufficient:

1. Railway: *"Replicas cannot be used with volumes."* A Raft node must fsync
   `currentTerm`, `votedFor` and its log before answering any RPC.
2. `<service>.railway.internal` resolves to a **randomly chosen** replica, so
   peers of a multi-replica service cannot address one another.
3. `RAILWAY_REPLICA_ID` is visible only inside the container that owns it and
   there is no ordinal index, so a replica has no durable identity to run Raft
   with.

This is Railway's own idiom for N durable, individually-addressable peers — the
same shape as their MongoDB replica-set template.

## `/healthz` is liveness. `/statusz` is leadership.

Deliberate, and worth restating because it looks like a bug the first time.
`/healthz` answers 200 as soon as the driver is running. A follower is healthy.
A node mid-election is healthy. Gating health on leadership would make Railway
restart-loop the two non-leaders of a perfectly functioning cluster.

The consequence: **`/healthz` going green does not mean the queue will accept a
write.** Until a node wins its election, every `Enqueue` returns `NotLeader`.
Anything that waits on `/healthz` and then enqueues is racing; wait on
`/statusz` reporting `"is_leader": true` instead.

## What the durability audit found (WU-10)

`backend/external/SGEE/tests/integration/queue_node_durability_test.sh`. Three
real nodes, `SIGKILL` the leader — not `SIGTERM`, because a clean shutdown is
the easy case. `SIGKILL` is what a host failure, an OOM kill and a container
eviction all look like.

**Durability holds.** Three consecutive runs, 50 acknowledged tasks each: zero
lost, zero duplicated, zero invented. Every task the queue acknowledged before
the leader died was still there after it died and rejoined.

**The read path does not.** Two defects, both reproducible on every run, both
absent from the `NO_KILL=1` control on the same three-node cluster — which is
what establishes they are failover-specific rather than properties of running
three nodes:

1. The first drain after a failover **stalls once** with the lease RPC returning
   `WalError: TimedOut`, and recovers on retry. The queue is briefly unable to
   serve reads after a leader crash.
2. **Exactly one task goes invisible for the full 30 s visibility window.** A
   lease RPC that times out on the *client* can still commit on the *server*,
   leaving the task leased to a worker that never saw it. An at-least-once
   consumer sees a stall it cannot explain.

Neither is data loss. Both are why this cluster is a mirror.

## How that audit almost reported the opposite

Recorded because the mistake is more instructive than the result.

The first version of the script reported **"43 acknowledged tasks LOST across
the leader kill"**. That was false. The drain had aborted on
`WalError: TimedOut` after seven tasks, and the script reported the tasks it had
never looked at as tasks that were gone — its own failure to *read*, presented
as the queue's failure to *keep*, about the most serious failure a queue can
have.

Three checks now stand between the script and that claim, and each was added
because it caught a real false positive:

- **The drain must COMPLETE.** If it aborts, the result is UNPROVEN in both
  directions and says so, rather than defaulting to the frightening reading.
- **The drain retries, and the attempt count is reported.** A stalled queue and
  a wedged one want different responses from an operator.
- **Nothing is called lost until the visibility window has been waited out and
  the queue drained again.** That single check turned "1 task LOST" — on two
  separate runs — into "1 task was hidden for 30 s and came back".

Duplicate delivery is deliberately *not* asserted when the drain took more than
one attempt: a task leased by an aborted attempt reappears legitimately on the
next one, and claiming "no duplicates" from that output would be unsupported.

## The first deployment crash-looped

All three nodes died on an uncaught `std::bad_variant_access` seconds after
finishing initialisation, restarted, and repeated — six to seven times each.

Two things about how it presented are worth more than the bug itself:

- **Railway reported every deployment `SUCCESS` throughout.** `/healthz` answers
  as soon as the driver is running, which is deliberate (see above), so it
  passes before the throw. `railway status` is not evidence a service is
  running; repeated boot banners in `railway logs` are what a crash loop looks
  like.
- **It was invisible for an entire deployment cycle.** `sgee::Log` writes with
  `std::println(std::cout, ...)` and never flushed. In a container stdout is a
  pipe and therefore fully buffered, so the node's eight boot lines never
  reached the log stream — the container answered `/healthz` while its log
  showed only Railway's own "Mounting volume" / "Starting Container". Fixing
  that (`std::cout << std::unitbuf`) is what made the crash visible at all.

**Cause:** a data race on `ReplicatedQueueRuntime::inbound_`.
`GrpcConsensusTransport` delivers inbound frames on its **own** server drain
thread; the runtime's `tick()` swaps that same `std::vector` on the owner
thread; neither took a lock. The module header argued none was needed — an
argument about *reentrancy*, correct on its own terms, that says nothing about
*concurrency* and held only while the sole transport was `InProcessTransport`
(which delivers synchronously, on the caller's thread).

**Fixed** with one mutex guarding that queue and nothing else. **Not confirmed
fixed in place:** it never reproduced locally. Five hypotheses were refuted
first — unreachable peers, unresolvable peer DNS, a three-node cluster with
leader SIGKILL, mismatched tokens, and a health-endpoint fuzz of fourteen
malformed shapes plus a 120-probe storm — and the local three-node durability
test passes **with the race present**, which is exactly why it was never caught.

A `std::set_terminate` handler now prints the exception type, `what()` and a
symbolised backtrace, so a recurrence names its own thread and frame instead of
one line naming neither.

## Before this is promoted to authoritative

- Fix the post-failover lease stall (`WalError: TimedOut`).
- Fix, or document a consumer contract for, the timed-out-lease-hides-a-task
  hazard.
- TLS/mTLS on both ports. Today the consensus port is authenticated by a shared
  token over **plaintext**, and the client queue port is **not authenticated at
  all** — `TaskQueueService`'s constructor takes no token. Railway's private
  network is a boundary, not an authentication: a co-tenant container is on the
  other side of it.
- Run the audit against the deployed Railway cluster, not only locally. Every
  number above is from three local processes on loopback.

## Gates

| test | what it would catch |
| --- | --- |
| `QueueNodeSmokeTest` | node does not elect, does not exit on SIGTERM, or does not persist to `SGEE_DATA_DIR` |
| `QueueNodeAuthTest` | `SGEE_QUEUE_TOKEN` not reaching the transport — mismatched tokens must fail to elect |
| `QueueNodeDurabilityTest` | acknowledged tasks lost, duplicated or invented across a leader kill |

All three hold one `RESOURCE_LOCK`: they bind fixed ports and kill by process
name, so running them concurrently under `ctest -j` would reproduce the
`SO_REUSEPORT` trap they each warn about, arriving through the test runner
instead of a stale developer process.
